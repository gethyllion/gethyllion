- 👋 Hi, I’m @gethyllion
- 👀 I haven recently interested in machine learning which helps me get into all kinds of sequence data of biology and dig out something that could be useful for targetting cancer gene.
- ❀ I am also interested in plants , for example succulents, orchid, epiphyte, which are little hobbies of mine.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and machine learning, in the future I may get to deep learning which is better at complex model with multiple dimensional data.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on some python script or module to deal with pre-processing sequence data.
- 📫 How to reach me : you may pm me at gibhub directly, I will reply to it as soon as possible, however I am not familiar with github system yet.
